# AirBnB Clone - The Console

### Description:

The Console, an AirBnB Clone, is a command-line tool designed to mimic the backend operations of the well-known online lodging reservation platform, AirBnB. Its objective is to emulate key features of AirBnB, enabling users to handle properties, users, and booking details via a text-based interface.

### Command interpreter

The command interpreter within the AirBnB Clone project acts as the main interface through which users engage with the application's backend functionality. It offers a text-based setting where users can input commands to carry out a range of tasks associated with property management, user handling, bookings, and additional functionalities.

### How it Works:

- When users initiate the command interpreter, they encounter a prompt signaling that the console is prepared to receive commands.
- Users enter commands alongside any necessary arguments or options, followed by pressing Enter to activate the command.
- The interpreter then handles the command, carries out the designated operation, and delivers feedback or output corresponding to the outcome.
